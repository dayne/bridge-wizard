Bridge Wizard
=============

*What is your name?*

A tool to maintain your local DNS entries via a *simple* (ghetto) web interface.

Pretty much just a sinatra web app wrapper around _nsupdate_ with GitHub authentication.


# setup of bridge wizard

    gem install bundler  # get ruby's bundler
    bundle install       # install the depenancies
