  ARTHUR:  There it is!  The Bridge of Death!
  ROBIN:  Oh, great.
  KNIGHT:  Look!
  ARTHUR:  There's the old man from Scene 24!
  BEDEMIR:  What is he doing here?
  ARTHUR:  He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.  He asks each
      traveller five questions--
  KNIGHT:  Three questions.
  ARTHUR:  Three questions.  He who answers the five questions--
  KNIGHT:  Three questions.
  ARTHUR:  Three questions may cross in safety.
  ROBIN:  What if you get a question wrong?
  ARTHUR:  Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.
  ROBIN:  Oh, I won't go.
  KNIGHT:  Who's going to answer the questions?
  ARTHUR:  Sir Robin!
  ROBIN:  Yes?
  ARTHUR:  Brave Sir Robin, you go.
  ROBIN:  Hey!  I've got a great idea.  Why doesn't Launcelot go?
  LAUNCELOT:  Yes, let me go, my liege.  I will take him single-handed.
      I shall make a feint to the north-east--
  ARTHUR:  No, no, hang on, hang on, hang on!  Just answer the five
      questions--
  KNIGHT:  Three questions.
  ARTHUR:  Three questions as best you can.  And we shall watch... and
      pray.
  LAUNCELOT:  I understand, my liege.
  ARTHUR:  Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot.  God be with you.
  KEEPER:  Stop!  Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me
      these questions three, 'ere the other side he see.
  LAUNCELOT:  Ask me the questions, bridge-keeper.  I'm not afraid.

  KEEPER:  Stop!  Who approaches the Bridge of Death must answer me
      these questions three, 'ere the other side he see.
